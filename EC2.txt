Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) provides an on-demand scalable computing capacity in AWS. EC2 reduces hardware costs and makes things easy for developers to develop and deploy applications faster. You can launch as many virtual servers and configure security manage storage. These EC2 runs on EC2 hosts and this is availability zone service which is available within the AZ. If the AZ fails the EC2 goes down.

EC2 SECURITY:

EC2 is secured with security groups which is a firewall which controls inbound and outbound traffic. A private key is stored on local machine and a public key stored on EC2 instance and only if these key pair match and a user proves their identity a user can have access to the EC2.

VIRTUALIZATION: 

Virtualization is a process of running more than one O.S with multiple applications on a single hardware or single server which is very effective. This process of functioning multiple O.S with different application can be done using hypervisor. A server with its O.S as such multiple servers with their different O.S are functioned to be run on a single hypervisor.

PARA VIRTUALIZATION:


EBS, SNAPSHOTS.
