CloudFormation 

AWS CloudFormation is a service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that enables users to provision and manage a collection of AWS resources in a predictable and repeatable manner. It allows you to define your infrastructure in a declarative template format, called a CloudFormation template, using JSON or YAML syntax. These templates can describe a wide range of AWS resources such as EC2 instances, S3 buckets, RDS databases, IAM roles, and more.

Let's simplify the definition, for example you need to build an infrastructure for an e-commerce website where you use EC2, S3, EBS, etc. Now if you try to create  these each one and connect them manually takes a lot of time and may also lead to infrastructure failure So, this can be easily done by the CloudFormation service where you write and describe your infrastructure in json or yaml by mentioning all your resources and then CloudFormation manages and builds your infrastructure  and if you need to make any changes or update the infrastructure you can make changes for the stack and update the template.

CloudFormation allows you to treat your infrastructure as code, enabling you to version-control, review, and replicate your infrastructure changes in a controlled and efficient manner. CloudFormation automatically determines the order in which resources need to be provisioned and updated based on their interdependencies specified in the template.CloudFormation tracks changes to your infrastructure over time and allows you to perform updates in a controlled manner, minimizing downtime and disruption. If a stack update fails, CloudFormation can automatically roll back to the previous known stable state, ensuring that your infrastructure remains in a consistent state. Resources provisioned by CloudFormation are organized into stacks, which represent a single unit of deployment and management. Stacks can be created, updated, or deleted as a whole. StackSets allow you to provision a CloudFormation stack across multiple AWS accounts and regions, making it easier to manage infrastructure across large-scale organizations. 

CloudFormation with  Resources :

CloudFormation by definition says that it can integrate with any third party resource, The infrastructure defined may need to have resources like GitHub, Docker/kubernetes, Terraform or Content Delivery Network Management which is widely used. CDNM  with CloudFormation, you can define CDN-related resources such as CloudFront distributions, origin configurations, cache behaviors, SSL certificates, and more in your CloudFormation templates. This allows you to provision and configure CDN resources in a repeatable and automated manner. So, Generally CF can be integrated with any kind of third party software which is required for the infrastructure.
