AMAZON CLOUDWATCH : 

Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It allows users to collect and track metrics, collect and monitor log files, set alarms, and automatically react to changes in AWS resources. For an instance, some application is running and the health of the application will be monitored on cloud watch and if something goes wrong it can be seen in cloud watch and can be solved.

Features of Cloudwatch :

Cloud Watch Metrics :

 CloudWatch Metrics are numeric data points representing various attributes or characteristics of AWS resources or services over time. These attributes can include CPU utilization, network traffic, disk I/O, latency, error rates, etc. Metrics are collected at regular intervals, typically every few minutes, depending on the specific service or resource being monitored.  Metrics within a namespace can have dimensions, which are key-value pairs that further define the scope of the metric. For instance, an EC2 metric might have dimensions such as instance ID, instance type, availability zone, etc. Dimensions help in filtering and aggregating metrics.  Each data point within a metric is associated with a timestamp, indicating when the measurement was taken. This allows for time-series analysis of metric data over different time periods.You can visualize CloudWatch Metrics using CloudWatch Dashboards, which allow you to create custom graphs and charts to monitor the performance of your AWS resources and services in real-time. CloudWatch Metrics can be used to set alarms based on thresholds. You can define thresholds for specific metrics, and CloudWatch will trigger alarms when those thresholds are breached, allowing for proactive monitoring and alerting.

Cloud Watch  Logs : 

Amazon CloudWatch Logs is a service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) for monitoring, storing, and accessing log files from various AWS resources and applications. It offers a centralized location for managing logs, enabling users to easily monitor and troubleshoot issues across their AWS infrastructure. CloudWatch Logs allows you to collect log data from a variety of AWS services and resources, including Amazon EC2 instances, AWS Lambda functions, Amazon VPC flow logs, AWS CloudTrail logs, and more. This log data in CloudWatch Logs is organized into "log groups" and "log streams."  CloudWatch Logs provides real-time monitoring capabilities, allowing you to view log data as it is generated by your AWS resources and applications.

Cloud Watch Alarms : 

CloudWatch Alarms allow you to set thresholds on CloudWatch Metrics and trigger actions when those thresholds are breached. You can define thresholds for various metrics such as CPU utilization, network traffic, error rates, etc., depending on the AWS resource being monitored. Each alarm is configured with one or more thresholds, which can be specified as absolute values or as a percentage of the metric. When you set a threshold for a metric and during the function when the metric reaches the limit an alarm notification will be sent and if it crosses the limit the alarms will be sent recently to fix the metric.  When a CloudWatch Alarm enters the "ALARM" state (indicating that the threshold has been breached), it can trigger one or more predefined actions. These actions can include sending notifications via Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service), triggering AWS Lambda functions, auto-scaling AWS resources, or initiating Amazon EC2 Auto Recovery. There are three stages in cloud watch alarm, OK state when the limit is within the threshold it is OK state and when the limit reaches the threshold it will be in ALARM STATE AND if there is not enough data to run a metric against threshold then it will be in DATA INSUFFICIENT state 

Cloud Watch Events :

CloudWatch Events supports a wide range of event sources within AWS, including but not limited to AWS services like Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, AWS Lambda, Amazon SQS, Amazon SNS,etc. CloudWatch Events uses event buses to route events to rules for processing. There are two types of event buses: default event buses and custom event buses. The default event bus captures events generated by AWS services within your account, while custom event buses allow you to ingest events from external sources or cross-account event sources.

Cloud Watch Insights :

Amazon CloudWatch Logs Insights is a feature within Amazon CloudWatch Logs that enables users to interactively search and analyze log data in real-time. CloudWatch Logs Insights allows users to query log data using a simple yet powerful query language. CloudWatch Logs Insights provides real-time analysis capabilities, allowing users to query and analyze log data as it is ingested into CloudWatch Logs. This enables users to detect and respond to events or issues in near real-time, helping to minimize downtime and improve operational efficiency.

Amazon Event Bridge : 

Amazon EventBridge is a serverless event bus service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that makes it easy to connect applications together using events. It enables you to build event-driven architectures by decoupling application components and allowing them to communicate with each other through events. Amazon EventBridge uses event buses as communication channels for passing events between event sources and event targets. There are two types of event buses: default event buses and custom event buses. The default event bus is managed by AWS and captures events from AWS services within your account. Custom event buses allow you to create dedicated event buses for specific use cases or applications. Event sources are services or applications that generate events and publish them to Amazon EventBridge for processing.


AWS Configuration : 

AWS Configuration  has two  main jobs, Primary job is to record configuration  changes over time on aws resources within an aws account once enabled, The configuration  of every resource in account is  monitored and if a configuration changes then a configuration item is created which stores the configuration of the resource at that point of time. This information stored on this is the configuration and relation to other resources. It does not prevent from changes to happen it just stores the changes. This this a regional service.

AWS Flow Logs :

Flow Logs are a feature provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allow you to capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC. This information includes details such as source and destination IP addresses, ports, protocol, and the amount of data transferred. VPC Flow Logs can be incredibly useful for monitoring, troubleshooting, and analyzing network traffic within your AWS infrastructure. Flow Logs capture information about network traffic flowing through the network interfaces of your VPC. This includes traffic between instances within the same VPC, traffic destined for the internet, and traffic between your VPC and other AWS services.  You can customize which types of traffic you want to log by specifying the network interfaces, subnets, or entire VPCs for which you want to enable flow logs. Flow logs are delivered to an Amazon S3 bucket in a specified logging format.   

Amazon Athena : 

Amazon Athena is serveless interactive querying service. Amazon Athena is an interactive query service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows you to analyze data stored in Amazon S3 using standard SQL queries. It's a serverless service, meaning you don't need to provision or manage any infrastructure; you only pay for the queries you run. Athena enables you to run SQL queries directly against data stored in Amazon S3, without needing to load it into a separate database or data warehouse. This makes it particularly useful for ad-hoc analysis of large datasets.
